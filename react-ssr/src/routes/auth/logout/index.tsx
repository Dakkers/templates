 * The work happens in `beforeLoad` so the session cookie is cleared before
 * anything renders. Nothing is ever shown: the route always redirects to the
 * login page.
 *
 * Careful when linking here: the router preloads on intent, and a preload runs
 * `beforeLoad`. Use `<Link to="/auth/logout" preload={false}>` so hovering the
 * link doesn't sign the user out.
